# Introduction

The aim of this post is to explain some of the consequences of Cebotarev density theorem.

First of all, we recall some definition we need, see chapter 13 of @Neukirch1999ANT.

::: {.definition}

**Definition:**
Let $K$ be a number field and $L/K$ be a Galois extension with Galois group $G$. For every $\sigma \in G$ we define $P _{L|K}(\sigma)$ as the set of all unramified prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}$ of $K$ such that there exists a prime ideal $\mathfrak{P}|\mathfrak{p}$ of $L$ satisfying
$$
	\sigma=\Big(\frac{L|K}{\mathfrak{P}}\Big)
$$
where $\Big(\frac{L|K}{\mathfrak{P}}\Big)$ is the Frobenius automorphism of $\mathfrak{P}$ over $K$.

:::

Since for all $\tau\in G$ we have
$$
	\Big(\frac{L|K}{\tau \mathfrak{P}}\Big)=\tau \Big(\frac{L|K}{\mathfrak{P}}\Big)\tau ^{-1}
$$
the set $P _{L|K}(\sigma)$ only depends on the conjugacy class
$$
\langle \sigma \rangle:=\{\tau\sigma\tau ^{-1} | \tau \in G\}
$$
Moreover, if $\langle\sigma\rangle\neq \langle \tau \rangle$ then $P _{L|K}(\sigma)\cap P _{L|K}(\tau)=\emptyset$.


We now want to define what a density is.

::: {.definition}

**Definition:**
Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. Set $A(n):=\{1,\dots, n\}\cap A$ and $a(n):=|A(n)|$. If the limit exists, we define the *natural density* $d(A)$ as
$$
d(A):=\lim _{n\to \infty}\frac{a(n)}{n}
$$

## The theorem

We are now ready to state the theorem

::: {#thm-chebotarev}
## Chebotarev density theorem

Let $K$ be a number field and $L/K$ be a finite Galois extension with Galois group $G$. Then for every $\sigma \in G$, the set $P _{L|K}(\sigma)$ has density (the limit exists), and it is given by
$$
	d(P _{L|K}(\sigma))=\frac{\#\langle \sigma\rangle}{\#G}
$$

We will not prove @thm-chebotarev, since the argument is long and technical. For a complete proof you can look at @Neukirch1999ANT.


# The consequences

We finally can learn about the corollaries of @thm-chebotarev.



## There are infinitely many primes splitting completely

::: {.definition}

**Definition:**
Let $L/K$ be a Galois extension of number fields and $\mathfrak{p}$ be a prime of $K$. We say that $\mathfrak{p}$ splits completely in $L$ if 
$$
	f(\mathfrak{p})=e(\mathfrak{p})=1
$$ 
where $f$ is the inertia index and $e$ is the ramification index. We define $P(L|K)$ as the set of primes of $K$ splitting completely in $L$.

::: {#cor-infinitelyprimessplitting}
## of @thm-chebotarev

Let $K$ be a number field and $L/K$ be a finite Galois extension. Then there are infinitely many primes of $K$ splitting completely in $L$.
:::

::: {.proof}

Let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a prime of $K$. For the same reasoning used in the proof of @lem-primesplitsiff we have
$$
	\mathfrak{p} \text{ splits completely in } L \iff \Big( \frac{L|K}{\mathfrak{P}} \Big)=1_G 
$$
Indeed, $\mathfrak{p}$ splits completely in $L$ means that it is unramified and that its inertia index is $1$. But this means that the decomposition group $D(\mathfrak{P}|\mathfrak{p})$ is trivial for every $\mathfrak{P}|\mathfrak{p}$. Since the Frobenius automorphism a generator of the group,
$$
	D(\mathfrak{P}|\mathfrak{p})=\{1\}\iff \Big(\frac{L|K}{\mathfrak{P}}\Big)=1_G
$$


Therefore, we get that $P(L|K)=P _{L|K}(1_G)$. Applying @thm-chebotarev we obtain
$$
	d(P(L|K))=\frac{1}{\# \mathrm{Gal}(L/K)}\neq 0
$$ 
hence the set $P(L|K)$ must be infinite (otherwise its density would be $0$.

## Characterization of number fields through splitting of primes

::: {#lem-primesplitsiff}
Let $K$ be a number field, let $L$ and $M$ be two finite Galois extensions of $K$, and $N:=LM$ the composite field. For every prime $\mathfrak{p}$ of $K$ unramified in $N$, pick a prime $\mathfrak{P}$ of $N$ above $\mathfrak{p}$. Then
$$
	\mathfrak{p}\in P(M|K)\iff \Big(\frac{N|K}{\mathfrak{P}}\Big)\in H_M
$$

:::
::: {.proof}

Since $M/K$ is Galois, the restriction map
$$
\mathrm{res}_M: G=\mathrm{Gal}(N/K)\to \mathrm{Gal}(M/K)
$$
is surjective with kernel $H_M$. Since $\mathfrak{p}$ is unramified, the Frobenius automorphism is well defined and it satisfies:
$$
	\mathrm{res}_M\Big(\Big(\frac{N|K}{\mathfrak{P}}\Big)\Big)=\Big(\frac{M|K}{\mathfrak{P}\cap M}\Big)\in \mathrm{Gal}(M/K)
$$ 
Now observe that $\mathfrak{p}$ splits completely in $M$ if and only if every prime of $M$ above $\mathfrak{p}$ has inertia index $1$ (since we already know that $\mathfrak{p}$ is unramified). Equivalently, (as seen in the proof of @cor-infinitelyprimessplitting)
$$
	\Big(\frac{M|K}{\mathfrak{P}}\Big)=1.
$$
This holds if and only if $\Big(\frac{N|K}{\mathfrak{P}}\Big)\in \mathrm{ker}(\mathrm{res}_M)=H_M$.

::: {#prp-characterization-of-number-fields}
## M. Bauer
Let $K$ be a number field and let $L$ and $M$ be two finite Galois extensions of $K$. Then
$$
	P(M|K) \subseteq P(L|K) \iff L \subseteq M
$$
Therefore, 
$$
	P(M|K)=P(L|K)\iff L=M
$$
In other words, the primes splitting completely determine univocally the number field.

:::

::: {.proof}

If $L \subseteq M$ then $P(M|K) \subseteq P(L|K)$ because of the multiplicativity of inertia and ramification index in towers of extensions.

Conversely, define the composite field $N:=LM$ and set
$$
G:=\mathrm{Gal}(N/K),\quad H_L:=\mathrm{Gal}(N/L),\quad H_M:=\mathrm{Gal}(N/M).
$$

Assume for the sake of contradiction that $L\not\subseteq M$. This is equivalent to $H_M\not \subseteq H_L$. Choose $g\in H_M\smallsetminus H_L$. Since $H_M$ and $H_L$ are normal,
$$
\langle g\rangle \subseteq H_M,\quad \langle g\rangle \cap H_L=\emptyset
$$

By @thm-chebotarev there are infinitely many primes $\mathfrak{p}$ of $K$ unramified in $N$ with Frobenius conjugacy class equal to $\langle g\rangle$ (if it was finite, the density would be $0$). For such a $\mathfrak{p}$, pick $\mathfrak{P}|\mathfrak{p}$ in $N$; then 
$$
	\Big(\frac{N|K}{\mathfrak{P}}\Big)\in \langle g\rangle \subseteq H_M
$$

By @lem-primesplitsiff
$$
\mathfrak{p}\in P(M|K)
$$
But also $\Big(\frac{N|K}{\mathfrak{P}}\Big)\notin H_L$, so $\mathfrak{p}\notin P(L|K)$. This contradicts $P(M|K) \subseteq P(L|K)$.
