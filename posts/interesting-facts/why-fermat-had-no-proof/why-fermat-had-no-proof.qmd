# Introduction

In 1637, Fermat stated that:

> It is impossible to separate a cube into two cubes, or a biquadrate into two biquadrate, or in general any power higher than the second into the power of like degree; I have discovered a truly remarkable proof which this margin is too small to contain." (@dickinson_history_1938)

This theorem is now known as Fermat's Last Theorem, and it can be stated as follows.

::: {#thm-fermat}
## Fermat's last theorem

Let $n\geq 3$ be an integer. The equation
$$
x^n+y^n=z^n
$$
has no non-trivial solutions $x,y,z\in \mathbb{Z}$.

:::

First, observe that we can reduce to consider only triples $(x,y,z)\in \mathbb{Z}^3$ with $\gcd(x,y,z)=1$. In particular, in this situation $x,y,z$ are pairwise coprime: for instance, if a prime $\ell$ divides $x$ and $z$, then it divides $z^q-x^q=y^q$, hence it divides $y$, contradicting $\gcd(x,y,z)=1$. Moreover, Fermat himself proved the theorem in the case $n=4$; therefore, using basic properties of powers, it is enough to prove the theorem for $n=q$, where $q$ is an odd prime.

To prove @thm-fermat, we could naively proceed in the following way. Fix an odd prime $q\geq 3$ and suppose that we had a non-trivial solution $x,y,z\in \mathbb{Z}$ of
$$
x^q+y^q=z^q
$$ {#eq-fermat}
Then, reducing this equation modulo every prime $p$ such that $p\nmid xyz$, we get a non-trivial solution modulo $p$. Therefore, only finitely many primes $p$ can fail to admit a non-trivial solution modulo $p$. If we proved that for infinitely many primes $p$ the reduction of @eq-fermat modulo $p$ has no non-trivial solution, then we would conclude that @eq-fermat has no integer solutions at all.

We will prove that this method cannot work. Indeed, we have the following.

::: {#thm-eventually .theorem}

There exists an integer $N\geq q$ such that for every prime $p>N$, @eq-fermat has a non-trivial solution in $\mathbb{F}_p$.

:::

Therefore, there are only finitely many primes with no non-trivial solution, which proves that the method cannot work.

## Warm up: a special case

::: {#prp-root-of-two .theorem}

Fix a prime $q$. There are infinitely many primes $p$ such that $2$ has a $q$-th root in $\mathbb{F}_p$.

:::

From this proposition we obtain that the equation $x^q+y^q=z^q$ has a non-trivial solution modulo $p$ for infinitely many primes $p$. Indeed, if $z^q=2$ in $\mathbb{F}_p$, we can choose $x=y=1$ and get
$$
1^q+1^q=z^q.
$$

::: {.proof}

#### Proof of @prp-root-of-two

This proposition is an easy corollary of [Corollary 5](https://sheafofthoughts.org/posts/interesting-facts/chebotarev-corollaries/chebotarev-corollaries.html#how-many-mathbbf_p-points) you can find in a [previous post](https://sheafofthoughts.org/posts/interesting-facts/chebotarev-corollaries/chebotarev-corollaries.html) about the Chebotarev density theorem, applied to the algebra $A:=\mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^q-2)$.
:::

::: {#rem-wearehappy}

Observe that the Chebotarev density theorem only tells us that we find infinitely many primes giving a solution to the equation, but it also tells us that the set of primes we find has density less than $1$. Therefore, it is not sufficient to establish what we want.

# Proof of @thm-eventually

The idea to prove @thm-eventually is to use a geometric fact. In particular, we want to study the projective curve
$$
X:=V_+(X^q+Y^q-Z^q)\subseteq \mathbb{P}^2_{\mathbb{F}_p},
$$
where $p\neq q$ are primes. Finding a non-trivial solution in $\mathbb{F}_p$ is the same as finding a point $[x:y:z]\in X(\mathbb{F}_p)$ such that $xyz\neq 0$.

After proving that $X$ satisfies the hypotheses of the [Weil conjectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weil_conjectures#Statement_of_the_Weil_conjectures), we will use them to establish, for $p$ large enough, a bound
$$
\#X(\mathbb{F}_p)> 3q,
$$
where $X(\mathbb{F}_p)$ denotes the $\mathbb{F}_p$-rational points. We will also prove that the points where one coordinate vanishes are $\le 3q$. Therefore, we will get the theorem as a direct consequence of the bound.

We now state the Weil conjectures in the form we need.

::: {#thm-weil}

#### Special case of the Weil conjectures

Suppose that $X$ is a smooth, geometrically irreducible, projective curve over the field $\mathbb{F}_p$, and let $g$ be the genus of $X$. The zeta function $\zeta(X,t)$ of $X$ is, by definition,
$$
\zeta(X,t):=\exp\Big(\sum_{m=1}^\infty \#X(\mathbb{F}_{p^m}) \frac{t^m}{m}\Big).
$$
Then $\zeta(X,t)$ is a rational function and can be written as
$$
\zeta(X,t)=\frac{P(t)}{(1-t)(1-pt)},
$$
where $P(t)\in\mathbb{Z}[t]$ has degree $2g$ and factors as
$$
P(t)=\prod_{i=1}^{2g}(1-\alpha_i t)
\qquad\text{with}\qquad |\alpha_i|=\sqrt{p}.
$$

:::

Now we are ready to prove @thm-eventually.

::: {.proof}

#### Proof of @thm-eventually

- **Step 1:** *There are at most $3q$ points of $X=V_+(X^q+Y^q-Z^q)\subseteq \mathbb{P}^2_{\mathbb{F}_p}$ such that at least one of the coordinates $x,y,z$ vanishes.*

  *Proof:* Consider the line $z=0$. On this line, the equation becomes $X^q+Y^q=0$, which is a homogeneous equation of degree $q$ on $\mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbb{F}_p}$, hence it has at most $q$ solutions over any field. Repeating the same argument for the lines $x=0$ and $y=0$ gives the claim.

- **Step 2:** *$X$ is a smooth, geometrically irreducible, projective curve of genus $g=\frac{(q-1)(q-2)}{2}$.*

  *Proof:* $X$ is projective by construction. It is smooth because $p\neq q$: if $F:=X^q+Y^q-Z^q$, then
  $$
  \frac{\partial F}{\partial X}=qX^{q-1},\qquad
  \frac{\partial F}{\partial Y}=qY^{q-1},\qquad
  \frac{\partial F}{\partial Z}=-qZ^{q-1},
  $$
  and since $q\not\equiv 0\pmod p$, these three partial derivatives cannot vanish simultaneously at any closed point of $\mathbb{P}^2 _{\overline{\mathbb{F}}_p}$.

  We now prove that $X$ is geometrically irreducible. This means that
  $$
  X\times_{\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb{F}_p)} \mathrm{Spec}(\overline{\mathbb{F}}_p)
  $$
  (where $\overline{\mathbb{F}_p}$ is an algebraic closure) is an irreducible topological space. If it were reducible, then $F$ would factor in $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_p[X,Y,Z]$ as a product $F=GH$ with $\deg(G),\deg(H)>0$. By Bézout's theorem we get that $V_+(G)\cap V_+(H)\neq \emptyset$. Pick $P\in V_+(G)\cap V_+(H)$. Then, for every $W\in\{X,Y,Z\}$,
  $$
  \frac{\partial F}{\partial W}=G\frac{\partial H}{\partial W}+H \frac{\partial G}{\partial W},
  $$
  so all partial derivatives of $F$ vanish at $P$, contradicting smoothness.

  Finally, since $X$ is a smooth plane curve of degree $q$, its genus is $g=\frac{(q-1)(q-2)}{2}$ (by [genus-degree formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus%E2%80%93degree_formula)).

- **Step 3:** *Apply @thm-weil.*

  From (in the following we work with formal series $\mathbb{C}[[t]]$)
  $$
  \zeta(X,t)=\exp\Big(\sum_{m=1}^\infty \#X(\mathbb{F}_{p^m}) \frac{t^m}{m}\Big)
  $$
  we get
  $$
  \#X(\mathbb{F}_p)=\Big(\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\log(\zeta(X,t))\Big)\Big|_{t=0}.
  $$
  Using
  $$
  \zeta(X,t)=\frac{P(t)}{(1-t)(1-pt)}
  \quad\text{and}\quad
  P(t)=\prod_{i=1}^{2g}(1-\alpha_i t),
  $$
  we obtain
  $$
  	\#X(\mathbb{F}_p)=\Big(\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\big(\log(P(t))-\log(1-t)-\log(1-pt)\big)\Big)\Big|_{t=0}
  $$
  hence
  $$
  \#X(\mathbb{F}_p)=p+1-\sum_{i=1}^{2g}\alpha_i.
  $$
  Since $|\alpha_i|=\sqrt{p}$ for all $i$, we deduce the bound
  $$
  \#X(\mathbb{F}_p)\geq p+1-2g \sqrt p
  =p+1-(q-1)(q-2)\sqrt p.
  $$

  Hence, for $p$ large enough, we have $\#X(\mathbb{F}_p)>3q$ (indeed the right-hand side approaches $+\infty$ when $p$ approaches $+\infty$). By Step 1, this implies that there must be a point $[x:y:z]\in X(\mathbb{F}_p)$ with $xyz\neq 0$, i.e. a non-trivial solution modulo $p$.

## Extending to $p$-adic solutions

We can extend the theorem thanks to [Hensel's lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hensel%27s_lemma). In particular, we can say the following.

::: {#thm-extension}
## Extension of @thm-eventually

There exists an integer $N\geq q$ such that for every prime $p>N$, the [Fermat equation](@eq-fermat) has a non-trivial solution in $(\mathbb{Z}_p)^\times$.
:::

From @thm-extension we get, in particular, a non-trivial solution in every $\mathbb{Z}/p^r\mathbb{Z}$ for every $r\geq 1$ and for every prime $p>N$.

Since we can factorize every integer as a product of primes, this tells us that if $m$ is an integer having at least one prime divisor $>N$, then $x^q+y^q=z^q$ has a non-trivial solution in $\mathbb{Z}/m \mathbb{Z}$.

::: {.proof}

#### Proof of @thm-extension

Fix a prime $p>N$. From @thm-eventually we know that there is a solution $(\overline a,\overline b,\overline c)\in(\mathbb{F}_p^\times)^3$ such that
$$
\overline a^q+\overline b^q=\overline c^q \quad\text{in }\mathbb{F}_p.
$$
Choose lifts $a,b,c_0\in \mathbb{Z}_p^\times$ such that $a\equiv \overline a$, $b\equiv \overline b$, $c_0\equiv \overline c \pmod p$. Define the polynomial $g(T):=a^q+b^q-T^q\in \mathbb{Z}_p[T]$.

Then

- $g(c_0)\equiv 0 \pmod p$;
- $g'(T)=-qT^{q-1}$, so $g'(c_0)\equiv -q\overline c^{\,q-1}\not \equiv 0 \pmod p$ (since $p\neq q$ and $\overline c\neq 0$).

By Hensel's lemma there is a unique $c\in \mathbb{Z}_p$ such that $c\equiv c_0 \pmod p$ and such that $c$ is a root of $g$ in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. In particular,
$$
a^q+b^q=c^q
\quad\text{in }\mathbb{Z}_p,
$$
so $(a,b,c)\in(\mathbb{Z}_p^\times)^3$ is a non-trivial $p$-adic solution.

# What do we bring with us

There are some general facts we used in our reasoning that could be used in other contexts. I would like to point out some of these things.

The first one is from Step 2 of the proof of @thm-eventually.

::: {#prp-F-irrid .theorem}

Let $k$ be a field and $F(X_1,\dots , X_n)\in k[X_1,\dots, X_n]$, with $n\geq 3$, a homogeneous polynomial. Define the ideal $J:=(\frac{\partial F}{\partial X_1},\dots , \frac{\partial F}{\partial X_n})$. If the intersection between the zeros of $J$ (closed points of $V(J)$) and the roots of $F$ is just $(0,\dots,0)$ in $\overline{k}^n$, then $F$ is irreducible in $\overline{k}$.

:::

Similarly, observe that the bound
$$
	\#X(\mathbb{F}_q)\geq p+1-(q-1)(q-2)\sqrt p
$$
deduced in Step 3 of the proof of @thm-eventually is true for every smooth, geometrically irreducible, projective curve of genus $\frac{(q-1)(q-2)}{2}$.

Moreover, you can check that the proof of @thm-eventually is actually a proof of the following more general fact:

::: {#thm-general}

Let $F(X,Y,Z)\in \mathbb{Z}[X,Y,Z]$ be a homogeneous polynomial, and $J:=(\frac{\partial F}{\partial X}, \frac{\partial F}{\partial Y}, \frac{\partial F}{\partial Z})$. Then, if eventually for every $p$ prime the intersection between the zeros of $J$ and the roots of $F$ is $(0,\dots, 0)$ (or empty) in $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_p^3$, $F$ has eventually non-trivial solutions modulo every $p$.

:::

Finally, we also proved in @thm-extension the following.

::: {#prp-hensel .theorem}

Let $A$ be a henselian local ring (a local ring where the one-variable Hensel lemma is true) with maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$, let $k$ be its residue field, let $f\in A[X_1,\dots, X_n]$, and let $a=(a_1,\dots,a_n)$ be a solution of $f$ in $k$ such that $\nabla f(a_1,\dots, a_n)\neq 0$ in $k$. Then there exists a solution $(s_1,\dots,s_n)$ of $f$ in $A$ such that $s_i\equiv a_i \bmod \mathfrak{m}$.

:::

# Conclusion

The key point is that reducing Fermat’s equation modulo primes is simply too weak to rule out integer solutions. In fact, for a fixed odd prime exponent $q$, the Fermat curve
$$
X: \; X^q+Y^q=Z^q
$$
has $\mathbb{F}_p$-points with all coordinates non-zero for every sufficiently large prime $p$.

Moreover, Hensel’s lemma shows that these solutions often lift to $\mathbb{Z}_p$, and hence give solutions modulo $p^r$ for all $r\ge 1$.

This helps explain why Fermat’s marginal claim is implausible: any proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem must use information that cannot be recovered by congruences modulo primes, modulo $n$, or elementary $p$-adic methods. However, we don't know whether Fermat could have proven the theorem using other techniques, as he did in the case $n=4$.
