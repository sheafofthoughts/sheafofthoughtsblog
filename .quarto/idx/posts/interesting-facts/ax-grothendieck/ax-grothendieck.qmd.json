[Artin–Tate's lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artin%E2%80%93Tate_lemma) then implies that $\\mathbb{Q}$ would be of finite type over $\\mathbb{Z}$, a contradiction.\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n---\n\n# Generalization to schemes\n\nNote that the map $F$ considered in [Theorem @thm-ax-special] can be seen as the map induced on closed points by a morphism of $k$-schemes $\\mathbb{A}^n_k\\rightarrow \\mathbb{A}^n_k$. This leads to the following question:\n\n::: {#qst-example}\n**Question:**\n\nLet $k$ be an algebraically closed field and $X$ a scheme of finite type over $k$. If $f:X\\rightarrow X$ is a $k$-endomorphism injective on $k$-points, is it surjective on all points?\n\n:::\n\nThe finite-type assumption is necessary: the map induced by\n$$\nk[X_1,\\dots, X_n,\\dots]\\to k[X_1,\\dots, X_n,\\dots]\n$$\nsending $X_1\\mapsto 0$ and $X_i\\mapsto X_{i-1}$ for $i>1$ is injective but not surjective.\n\nThe answer is positive, and it follows (not trivially) from the following theorem.\n\n::: {#thm-ax-groth}\n## Ax–Grothendieck Theorem\n\nLet $S$ be a scheme and let $X$ be a scheme of finite type over $S$. Any injective $S$-endomorphism $f:X\\rightarrow X$ is bijective.\n:::\n\nMoreover, if $X$ is reduced and $k$ is an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$, then an injective endomorphism on $k$-points is in fact an isomorphism (not merely a bijection). This is not trivial since we have bijective morphisms of schemes that are not isomorphisms (for example the one induced by $k[t^2,t^3]\\rightarrow k[t]$). A reference for this is Lemma 1 of [this article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4097654).\n\nWe will not give a proof of [Theorem @thm-ax-groth]; see J. Ax's paper [Injective endomorphisms of varieties and schemes](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/pacific-journal-of-mathematics/volume-31/issue-1/Injective-endomorphisms-of-varieties-and-schemes/pjm/1102978046.full), or Grothendieck's version in [EGA IV$_3$, Proposition 10.4.11](https://www.numdam.org/item/PMIHES_1966__28__5_0/) for a complete proof.\n\nLet us explain why [Theorem @thm-ax-groth] implies that injectivity on $k$-points gives surjectivity on all points.\n\nThe first ingredient is Chevalley's theorem on constructible sets (see Hartshorne, Ex. II.3.19).\n\n::: {#thm-chevalley}\n## Chevalley's theorem\n\nLet $f:X\\to Y$ be a finite type morphism between noetherian schemes. If $Z \\subseteq X$ is a constructible subset (i.e. a finite union of locally closed subsets), then $f(Z)$ is constructible.\n:::\n\nThe following lemma explains why [Theorem @thm-ax-groth] implies [Theorem @thm-ax-special].\n\n::: {#lem-universally-injective}\n\nLet $X, Y$ be schemes of finite type over an algebraically closed field $k$. Let $f:X\\to Y$ be a morphism whose restriction to $k$-points\n$$\nf: X(k)\\to Y(k)\n$$\nis injective. Then $f$ is universally injective.\n:::\n\nAssuming this lemma, consider a morphism $f:\\mathbb{A}^n_k\\to \\mathbb{A}^n_k$ over $k$ which is injective on closed points (which are exactly the $k$-points, since $k$ is algebraically closed). Then in particular $f$ is injective on all points. From [Theorem @thm-ax-groth] we get the surjectivity of $f$ on all points (answering the question raised before) and in particular also surjectivity on closed points, since only closed points are sent to closed points. In particular, we obtain [Theorem @thm-ax-special].\n\n::: {.proof}\n#### Of [Lemma @lem-universally-injective]\n\nObserve that the diagonal $\\Delta_f:X\\to X\\times_Y X$ is of finite type. Indeed, it is locally of finite type because $X\\to \\mathrm{Spec}(k)$ is locally of finite type (and $\\Delta_f$ can be seen as the first factor of this map), and it is quasi-compact because $X$ is noetherian (being of finite type over $k$).\n\nMoreover, the diagonal $\\Delta_f$ is surjective on $k$-points. Indeed, for any $k$-point of $X\\times_Y X$ given by a morphism\n$$\n\\psi: \\mathrm{Spec}(k)\\to X\\times_Y X\n$$\nwe can consider the diagram\n\n<!-- https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsNSxbMCwwLCJcXG1hdGhybXtTcGVjfShrKSJdLFsxLDEsIlhcXHRpbWVzX1kgWCJdLFsyLDEsIlgiXSxbMSwyLCJYIl0sWzIsMiwiWSJdLFsxLDJdLFswLDIsIlxccGhpXzIiLDAseyJjdXJ2ZSI6LTN9XSxbMSw0LCIiLDIseyJzdHlsZSI6eyJuYW1lIjoiY29ybmVyIn19XSxbMiw0XSxbMyw0XSxbMSwzXSxbMCwzLCJcXHBoaV8xIiwyLHsiY3VydmUiOjN9XSxbMCwxLCJcXHBzaSIsMl1d -->\n<iframe class=\"quiver-embed\" src=\"https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsNSxbMCwwLCJcXG1hdGhybXtTcGVjfShrKSJdLFsxLDEsIlhcXHRpbWVzX1kgWCJdLFsyLDEsIlgiXSxbMSwyLCJYIl0sWzIsMiwiWSJdLFsxLDJdLFswLDIsIlxccGhpXzIiLDAseyJjdXJ2ZSI6LTN9XSxbMSw0LCIiLDIseyJzdHlsZSI6eyJuYW1lIjoiY29ybmVyIn19XSxbMiw0XSxbMyw0XSxbMSwzXSxbMCwzLCJcXHBoaV8xIiwyLHsiY3VydmUiOjN9XSxbMCwxLCJcXHBzaSIsMl1d&embed\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" style=\"border-radius: 8px; border: none;\"></iframe>\n\nand by injectivity of the morphism $X\\to Y$ we obtain $\\phi_1=\\phi_2$ as maps of topological spaces. They are also the same on the structure sheaf, because $k$ is algebraically closed. Therefore, $\\phi_1=\\phi_2$, which means that $\\psi$ factorizes through the diagonal $\\Delta_f$.\n\nFurthermore, $X\\times _Y X$ is a [Jacobson](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/005T) scheme (i.e. its underlying topological space is Jacobson) because it is of finite type over $k$, and $k$ is Jacobson. By [Theorem @thm-chevalley] the set $\\Delta_f(X)$ is constructible. Consider $Z:=(X\\times_Y X)\\smallsetminus \\Delta_f(X)$. This is constructible and every closed point of $X\\times_Y X$ lies inside $\\Delta_f(X)$ (by surjectivity of $\\Delta_f$ on closed points). Since every nonempty constructible subset in a Jacobson scheme contains a closed point, it follows that $Z=\\emptyset$. Therefore, $\\Delta_f$ is surjective on all points.\n\nNow we prove that the surjectivity of $\\Delta_f$ implies the universal injectivity of $f$. Indeed, consider any $g: Z\\to Y$ and the diagonal\n$$\n\\Delta: X\\times_Y Z\\to (X\\times_Y Z)\\times_Z(X\\times_Y Z)\n$$\nof the base change. This diagonal map $\\Delta$ is surjective because it is the base change of $\\Delta_f$, which is surjective. Thus, we are reduced to proving that surjectivity of $\\Delta_f$ implies injectivity of $f$ (the same will then hold for any base change).\n\nConsider $x_1,x_2\\in X$ with $f(x_1)=f(x_2)=:y$.

Any injective $S$-endomorphism $f:X\\rightarrow X$ is bijective.\n:::\n\nMoreover, if $X$ is reduced and $k$ is an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$, then an injective endomorphism on $k$-points is in fact an isomorphism (not merely a bijection). This is not trivial since we have bijective morphisms of schemes that are not isomorphisms (for example the one induced by $k[t^2,t^3]\\rightarrow k[t]$). A reference for this is Lemma 1 of [this article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4097654).\n\nWe will not give a proof of [Theorem @thm-ax-groth]; see J. Ax's paper [Injective endomorphisms of varieties and schemes](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/pacific-journal-of-mathematics/volume-31/issue-1/Injective-endomorphisms-of-varieties-and-schemes/pjm/1102978046.full), or Grothendieck's version in [EGA IV$_3$, Proposition 10.4.11](https://www.numdam.org/item/PMIHES_1966__28__5_0/) for a complete proof.\n\nLet us explain why [Theorem @thm-ax-groth] implies that injectivity on $k$-points gives surjectivity on all points.\n\nThe first ingredient is Chevalley's theorem on constructible sets (see Hartshorne, Ex. II.3.19).\n\n::: {#thm-chevalley}\n## Chevalley's theorem\n\nLet $f:X\\to Y$ be a finite type morphism between noetherian schemes. If $Z \\subseteq X$ is a constructible subset (i.e. a finite union of locally closed subsets), then $f(Z)$ is constructible.\n:::\n\nThe following lemma explains why [Theorem @thm-ax-groth] implies [Theorem @thm-ax-special].\n\n::: {#lem-universally-injective}\n\nLet $X, Y$ be schemes of finite type over an algebraically closed field $k$. Let $f:X\\to Y$ be a morphism whose restriction to $k$-points\n$$\nf: X(k)\\to Y(k)\n$$\nis injective. Then $f$ is universally injective.\n:::\n\nAssuming this lemma, consider a morphism $f:\\mathbb{A}^n_k\\to \\mathbb{A}^n_k$ over $k$ which is injective on closed points (which are exactly the $k$-points, since $k$ is algebraically closed). Then in particular $f$ is injective on all points. From [Theorem @thm-ax-groth] we get the surjectivity of $f$ on all points (answering the question raised before) and in particular also surjectivity on closed points, since only closed points are sent to closed points. In particular, we obtain [Theorem @thm-ax-special].\n\n::: {.proof}\n#### Of [Lemma @lem-universally-injective]\n\nObserve that the diagonal $\\Delta_f:X\\to X\\times_Y X$ is of finite type. Indeed, it is locally of finite type because $X\\to \\mathrm{Spec}(k)$ is locally of finite type (and $\\Delta_f$ can be seen as the first factor of this map), and it is quasi-compact because $X$ is noetherian (being of finite type over $k$).\n\nMoreover, the diagonal $\\Delta_f$ is surjective on $k$-points. Indeed, for any $k$-point of $X\\times_Y X$ given by a morphism\n$$\n\\psi: \\mathrm{Spec}(k)\\to X\\times_Y X\n$$\nwe can consider the diagram\n\n<!-- https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsNSxbMCwwLCJcXG1hdGhybXtTcGVjfShrKSJdLFsxLDEsIlhcXHRpbWVzX1kgWCJdLFsyLDEsIlgiXSxbMSwyLCJYIl0sWzIsMiwiWSJdLFsxLDJdLFswLDIsIlxccGhpXzIiLDAseyJjdXJ2ZSI6LTN9XSxbMSw0LCIiLDIseyJzdHlsZSI6eyJuYW1lIjoiY29ybmVyIn19XSxbMiw0XSxbMyw0XSxbMSwzXSxbMCwzLCJcXHBoaV8xIiwyLHsiY3VydmUiOjN9XSxbMCwxLCJcXHBzaSIsMl1d -->\n<iframe class=\"quiver-embed\" src=\"https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsNSxbMCwwLCJcXG1hdGhybXtTcGVjfShrKSJdLFsxLDEsIlhcXHRpbWVzX1kgWCJdLFsyLDEsIlgiXSxbMSwyLCJYIl0sWzIsMiwiWSJdLFsxLDJdLFswLDIsIlxccGhpXzIiLDAseyJjdXJ2ZSI6LTN9XSxbMSw0LCIiLDIseyJzdHlsZSI6eyJuYW1lIjoiY29ybmVyIn19XSxbMiw0XSxbMyw0XSxbMSwzXSxbMCwzLCJcXHBoaV8xIiwyLHsiY3VydmUiOjN9XSxbMCwxLCJcXHBzaSIsMl1d&embed\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" style=\"border-radius: 8px; border: none;\"></iframe>\n\nand by injectivity of the morphism $X\\to Y$ we obtain $\\phi_1=\\phi_2$ as maps of topological spaces. They are also the same on the structure sheaf, because $k$ is algebraically closed. Therefore, $\\phi_1=\\phi_2$, which means that $\\psi$ factorizes through the diagonal $\\Delta_f$.\n\nFurthermore, $X\\times _Y X$ is a [Jacobson](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/005T) scheme (i.e. its underlying topological space is Jacobson) because it is of finite type over $k$, and $k$ is Jacobson. By [Theorem @thm-chevalley] the set $\\Delta_f(X)$ is constructible. Consider $Z:=(X\\times_Y X)\\smallsetminus \\Delta_f(X)$. This is constructible and every closed point of $X\\times_Y X$ lies inside $\\Delta_f(X)$ (by surjectivity of $\\Delta_f$ on closed points). Since every nonempty constructible subset in a Jacobson scheme contains a closed point, it follows that $Z=\\emptyset$. Therefore, $\\Delta_f$ is surjective on all points.\n\nNow we prove that the surjectivity of $\\Delta_f$ implies the universal injectivity of $f$. Indeed, consider any $g: Z\\to Y$ and the diagonal\n$$\n\\Delta: X\\times_Y Z\\to (X\\times_Y Z)\\times_Z(X\\times_Y Z)\n$$\nof the base change. This diagonal map $\\Delta$ is surjective because it is the base change of $\\Delta_f$, which is surjective. Thus, we are reduced to proving that surjectivity of $\\Delta_f$ implies injectivity of $f$ (the same will then hold for any base change).\n\nConsider $x_1,x_2\\in X$ with $f(x_1)=f(x_2)=:y$. We can find a field $L$ such that the following diagram commutes:\n\n<!-- https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsNCxbMCwxLCJrKHkpIl0sWzEsMCwiayh4XzEpIl0sWzEsMiwiayh4XzIpIl0sWzIsMSwiTCJdLFswLDFdLFswLDJdLFsyLDNdLFsxLDNdXQ== -->\n<iframe class=\"quiver-embed\" src=\"https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsNCxbMCwxLCJrKHkpIl0sWzEsMCwiayh4XzEpIl0sWzEsMiwiayh4XzIpIl0sWzIsMSwiTCJdLFswLDFdLFswLDJdLFsyLDNdLFsxLDNdXQ==&embed\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" style=\"border-radius: 8px; border: none;\"></iframe>\n\nWe get the following commutative diagram:\n<!-- https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsNSxbMCwwLCJcXG1hdGhybXtTcGVjfShMKSJdLFsxLDEsIlhcXHRpbWVzX1kgWCJdLFsxLDIsIlgiXSxbMiwxLCJYIl0sWzIsMiwiWSJdLFswLDEsIlxcZXhpc3RzISBcXGVwc2lsb24iLDEseyJzdHlsZSI6eyJib2R5Ijp7Im5hbWUiOiJkb3R0ZWQifX19XSxbMSwyXSxbMSwzXSxbMyw0XSxbMiw0XSxbMCwyLCJ4XzEiLDIseyJjdXJ2ZSI6M31dLFswLDMsInhfMiIsMCx7ImN1cnZlIjotM31dLFsxLDQsIiIsMCx7InN0eWxlIjp7Im5hbWUiOiJjb3JuZXIifX1dXQ== -->\n<iframe class=\"quiver-embed\" src=\"https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsNSxbMCwwLCJcXG1hdGhybXtTcGVjfShMKSJdLFsxLDEsIlhcXHRpbWVzX1kgWCJdLFsxLDIsIlgiXSxbMiwxLCJYIl0sWzIsMiwiWSJdLFswLDEsIlxcZXhpc3RzISBcXGVwc2lsb24iLDEseyJzdHlsZSI6eyJib2R5Ijp7Im5hbWUiOiJkb3R0ZWQifX19XSxbMSwyXSxbMSwzXSxbMyw0XSxbMiw0XSxbMCwyLCJ4XzEiLDIseyJjdXJ2ZSI6M31dLFswLDMsInhfMiIsMCx7ImN1cnZlIjotM31dLFsxLDQsIiIsMCx7InN0eWxlIjp7Im5hbWUiOiJjb3JuZXIifX1dXQ==&embed\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" style=\"border-radius: 8px; border: none;\"></iframe>\n\nBy surjectivity of $\\Delta_f$ we can find $x\\in X$ such that $\\Delta_f(x)$ is the image of $\\epsilon$, hence we get $x_1=x_2$. This shows that $f$ is injective, and therefore universally injective.\n:::\n\nNote that the complex-geometric picture does not match the algebraic one. For example, there are holomorphic maps $\\mathbb{C}^n\\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}^n$ that are injective but not surjective. However, this cannot happen for $n=1$, as one can show that all holomorphic injective maps $f: \\mathbb{C}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}$ are of the form $f=ax+b$; see the [Casorati–Weierstrass theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casorati%E2%80%93Weierstrass_theorem).\n\n---\n\n# Conclusion\n\nTo conclude, we point your attention to the fact that this theorem is linked to a famous conjecture, namely the [Jacobian conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_conjecture).\n\n::: {#cnj-jacobian}\n## Jacobian conjecture\n\nLet $k$ be a field of characteristic $0$ and let $F: k^n\\to k^n$ be a polynomial mapping. If the Jacobian determinant $J_F$ is invertible, then $F$ is an isomorphism.\n:::\n\nOver an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$, the fact that the bijection in [Theorem @thm-ax-groth] becomes an isomorphism shows that, to prove the Jacobian conjecture for $\\mathbb{A}^n_k$, it suffices to show that a map\n$$\nF:\\mathbb{A}^n_k\\rightarrow \\mathbb{A}^n_k\n$$\nwith invertible Jacobian determinant is injective.\n\n---\n\nI would like to thank my friend who suggested this topic to me and helped me write this post.\n\n---\n\n# References\n\nThis post was mainly inspired by [this post](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2009/03/07/infinite-fields-finite-fields-and-the-ax-grothendieck-theorem/comment-page-1/) from Terence Tao's blog.
