First, observe that we are only interested in odd primes (i.e., all primes other than $2$), since we already know that $2$ can be written as the sum of two squares. Therefore, we start to look at them carefully and conjecture the following fact: \n\n>All _odd_ primes that can be written as the sum of two squares have remainder $1$ when divided by $4$.\n\n\nHowever, this only tells us that *if* an odd prime is a sum of two squares, then it leaves remainder $1$ when divided by $4$.\nBut in general it's not easy to check whether a prime is the sum of two squares, since we'd have to try many possibilities (look at $7$ and imagine larger primes).
