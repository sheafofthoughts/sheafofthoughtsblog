I am a master's student in mathematics, mostly interested in algebraic stuff.
In this blog I share things that I find interesting while I study.

I write as a student who is still learning, and these posts are a way to collect what I study and to share it with others.

## Projects

### Interesting facts
Posts on more advanced topics that I encounter along the way (ideas that I like, want to remember, or want to understand better).

### Route to the Fermat's Christmas Theorem
Short weekly notes (aimed to non-experts) developing most of the theory needed to give a complete proof of the Fermat's Christmas Theorem, starting from the very basics. I will try to write the posts in a very simple language, so that anyone could easily follow along.
